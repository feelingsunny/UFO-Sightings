JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Website that creates a table dynamically based on an array of JavaScript objects, and searches data to find rows that match user input.

Automatic Table and Date Search

Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.


Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
